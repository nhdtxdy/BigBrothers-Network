# Preface

Have you ever wanted to boost your interaction stats on Facebook, but those likebots look to shady to use? üò±

Then get started with this new **anti-bot** platform üòé

BigBrothers Netowrk is a social media for users to interact with Facebook posts to earn tokens and use tokens to earn more interaction on Facebook posts. And tokens can be exchanged for real money! üòè

# Introduction
This is an ongoing project. This repository contains just the open-source parts of BigBrothers Network (i.e Front-end and some Back-end logic) without disclosing in details how backend security works. As a result, information relating to database, payments and server-side security mechanism are not published, or heavily obfuscated.

To create your own version of BigBrothers Network, database, payments and the interaction verification system should be implemented from scratch.

# Installation

To deploy this repository you need `NodeJS` and `MongoDB` installed. You also need to create a [Facebook application supporting OAuth](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login).

Then type the following commands 

```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/nhdtxdy/BigBrothers-Network
$ cd BigBrothers-Network
```

Now that the repo is local:

```sh
$ cd core
$ npm i # install dependencies
```

Then, in `core/.env`, replace the system variables as you wish:
- `APPID` specifies the ID of your Facebook application.
- `SECRET` specifies the secret of your Facebook application.
- `HTTP_PORT` and `HTTPS_PORT` if you want to change default ports.
- `MONGO_SERVER` specifies the MongoDB server's address.

# Future Developments
- Addition: Stripe API to allow purchase of tokens and convert from tokens to money
- Amendment: allow for more interactions - comments and shares.
